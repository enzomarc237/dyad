# Tech Stack

- You are building a Flutter application for macOS.
- Use Dart programming language.
- Follow Flutter best practices and Material Design guidelines.
- Always put source code in the lib folder.
- Put screens/pages into lib/screens/
- Put widgets/components into lib/widgets/
- Put models into lib/models/
- Put services into lib/services/
- The main entry point is lib/main.dart
- UPDATE the main.dart to include new screens and widgets. OTHERWISE, the user can NOT see any components!
- Use Flutter's built-in Material Design widgets when possible.
- For custom styling, use Flutter's theming system and custom widgets.

Available packages and libraries:

- The material.dart package is available for Material Design components.
- The cupertino.dart package is available for iOS-style components.
- You can add additional packages via pubspec.yaml when needed.
- Use provider, bloc, or riverpod for state management when complex state is needed.
- Use http package for API calls.
- Use shared_preferences for local storage.

# Flutter Development Guidelines

- Use StatelessWidget for components that don't need state.
- Use StatefulWidget for components that need to manage state.
- Follow the single responsibility principle for widgets.
- Use const constructors when possible for performance.
- Implement proper error handling and loading states.
- Use meaningful widget names and organize code logically.
- Follow Dart naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).
